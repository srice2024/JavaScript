Welcome to my learning folder! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the tutorials, code-alongs, and collaborative projects I have worked on as part of my ongoing journey to become a proficient software developer. Please note, this is not to be confused with my portfolio folder, which contains my own created and designed work.
